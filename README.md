# Word-Dictionary
A Word Dictionary has been created based on the concept of Linked List. Binary Search Tree method has been used to store the words in that dictionary. With respect to parent word lesser lengthen words are placed in leff-subtree and greater lengthen words are placed in right-subtree respectively.
At first in this problem we considered a Linked List to store words. Then we used Binary Search Tree method to store these words in an order where the left-subtree means the lesser word in length with respect to their parent and right-subtree means the greater word in length with respect to their parent .We created a file to save the word .Adding word, printing in preorder, postorder and inorder and finding maximum length word, minimum length word and deleting a word, searching a word  function are included in this project. If a searched word is not found similar words are shown as suggestion.
